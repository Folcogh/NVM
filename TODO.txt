Start Cinescenie
----------------
QList<ExecEvent> is built
ExecEvent contains a message and a timecode (QTime), containing events generated by Events top, their announces and their final countdown
Current time is saved, it's the reference for

every 200ms:
- ExecEvent are scanned: compare their real time trigger with current time
  - an ExecEvent whose trigger time is >= launches its sound if requested, then is removed from the table
  - next event message is adjusted
- remaining time is refreshed in the table
- next event display is refreshed



// At start, all events whose timecode is < start timecode should be discarded
// The problem is:
- they could be announced because eventTC <= currentTC
- or an announce could be skipped if we only announce event when eventTC == currentTC
